<h1>The Story</h1>
    
<br> 
<h2>Chapter 1 - Toad%</h2>
<br> 
</div>	
    
<div class=center>
<p>I got the idea of the "Toad%" (later renamed to 6 Toad) category sometime in november of 2017 when i saw DNVIC running Super Mario 64 16 Star.<br>
He was in the HMC split and had to talk to toad for the star but instead puching him many times i laughed at this maybe too much and jokingly said "ill make toad%".<br>
So i fired up Super Mario 64 and started looking for the toad locations and i found 8 of them but 2 of them needed a certain ammount of stars to appear.<br>
The one at HMC needed 12 and the one next to TTC needed 34 so being a bad speedrunner i decided that the one with 6 toads and 16 stars became the main one.<br>
Then came the part of deciding where the run ends i thought it needed to be more different from 16 star so i decided to use the dumbest one.<br>
WDW Clip, the trick that new 16 star runners did many times accidentally became the way to end the run only because it was the dumbest one.<br>
With that idea in my mind i created a google doc file for it but im not sure who did the first run but the first three were these:<br>
(According to google docs these were added 18 Nov 2017 but sadly no video has survived of these)</p>
</div>	

<div class=center>
<p>
1st mrlink2k 24:46.73 (EMU USA)<br>
2nd SioN 35:32.32 (N64 PAL)<br>
3rd DNVIC 36:01.18 (EMU USA)</p>
</div>	
    

<div class=center>
<p>The next day we got our first 6 Toad runners that i didn't know before, Nathan and Mango.  So we decided that mrlink2k and the two new comers would race.<br>
We went into a discord call and the three racers shared their screens, during this race 7 new personal bests had been gotten.<br>
Nathan's first time that i added to the leaderboard was 31:21 and Mango's was 21:22. mrlink2k also got a personal best of 22:22.<br>
Mango dominated mrlink2k and Nathan during the races and set a new world record of 19:30. and still sadly no videos exist</p>
</div>	

<div class=center>
<p>
1st Mango 19:30 (EMU)<br>
2nd mrlink2k 22:22 (EMU)<br>
3rd Nathan 22:23 (EMU)<br>

5th DNVIC 36:01.18 (EMU USA)</p>  
</div>	 
    
<div class=center>
<p>Time passed and 2017 went and 2018 came and on the 1st of January a new runner RWBYSorry claimed to have gotten a 18:55 on emulator but had no proof.<br>
In the 15th of January we got two new runners but not on the 6 Toad category, they did runs of the 5 Toad category which only collects 1 star.<br>
The new runners were BennyMKW and JeremyMKW they were racing 1 star on twitch when i found BennyMKW's stream and asked if he could do a Toad% run.<br>
He agreed and JeremyMKW also decided to try some runs.  Jeremy got a 13:40 time but he wasn't recording or streaming and Benny got a 9:55 that still has a <a href="run/benn955sm5t.html">video.</a><br>
The next day RWBYSorry wanted to try the longest category 8 Toad, in it you collect 35 stars because the last toad need 34 to appear the final time was 30:40.<br>
22nd of January had me and a new runner LumboJacko racing 6 toad on stream.  I won the race and got a new pb of 19:51 the video is <a href="run/sion1951sm6t.html">here</a></p>
</div>	

<div class=center>
<p>in the 13th of Febuary we once again got a new runner SilverMane who got a 21:12 6 Toad time <a href="run/silv2112sm6t.html">(video)</a><br>
20th of March a friend of mine Camtumin also did a 6 Toad run and got a 18:38 a new world record <a href="run/camt1838sm6t.html">(video link dead)</a><br>
The next day RWBYSorry did a 6 Toad run and got a new world record with a time of 17:04 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lc89VzZRfyA">(video)</a><br>
29th of March we decided to make a Toad% discord server so we had a place to talk in.<br>
In the 7th of April mrlink2k decided that we are going to have a 6 Toad tournament in the 28th of April<br>
14th of April ZephXavier stole DNVIC's 6 Toad N64 wr with a 26:15 <a href="run/zeph2615sm6t.html">(end clip)</a> but later in the same day DNVIC got it back with a 24:28 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zxEHqL8kEc&feature=youtu.be">(video)</a></p>
</div>	

<div class=center>
<p>27th of April RWBYSorry came back with a new 6 Toad world record with a time of 16:55 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaUlQ_Ugsr8&feature=youtu.be">(video.)</a><br>
It is now the 28th of April the day of the 6 Toad tournament that had gotten 7 runners some who hadn't done a run before<br>
The tournament technically failed, every race had been done but we ended up in a fight and most of us parted ways not talking to each other for a little while<br>
This killed Toad% and the disord fell quiet<br>
But me, DNVIC, mrlink2k and others got over it sometime after and later DNVIC helped me make a new leaderboard this time an actual website made in html<br>
The new leaderboard was done in the 6th of June and what was left of the community moved there</p>
